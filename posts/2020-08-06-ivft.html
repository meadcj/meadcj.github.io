<p>The <a href="https://etx.asu.edu">ETX Center</a> is one of the leaders in advancing the technology and learning design of what we refer to as immersive, interactive virtual field trips, or <a href="https://vft.asu.edu">iVFT</a>. I have previously published a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10899995.2019.1565285">curriculum &amp; instruction study</a> describing the design ideas behind iVFTs and demonstrating their educational effectiveness. Future work will explore the value of specific design approaches within iVFTs as well as their capacity to develop learners' understanding of the process of science or transdisciplinary connections that go beyond science.</p>

<p>The two empirical studies of the value of iVFTs for learning that I have published (the paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10899995.2019.1565285">above</a> and a more recent <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2022.836783">one</a>). Both employed a pretest/posttest design and both showed statistically significant and typically large learning gains for students who complete the iVFTs. These studies were conducted in both high school and undergraduate settings. I have also contributed to a comparative study of learning in iVFTs, which showed them to be associated with <em>larger</em> learning gains than an in-person field trip. That study is in peer review.</p>
<p>Finally, I am the education research lead for an NSF-funded project to build an iVFT-based learning experience teaching polar science, called <a href="https://etx.asu.edu/major-projects/polar-explorer/">Polar Explorer</a>. The learning design of Polar Explorer will draw on everything we at the ETX Center have learned about how to use this technology to convey a sense of place and to promote active and inquiry-based learning.</p>
