<p>Schussler, E. E., Weatherton, M., Chen Musgrove, M. M., Brigati, J. R., &amp; England, B. J. (2021). CBEâ€”Life Sciences Education, 20(2), ar29.</p>
<h2>What it says</h2>
<ul>
<li>Although the authors set out to examine instructional practices that increased and decreased student anxiety, their results ultimately speak more broadly to what separates supportive instructors from unsupportive ones.</li>
<li>They collected surveys from about 900 students across six biology classes. They then took a qualitative coding approach to identify common themes in how students described their instructors' supportiveness. </li>
<li>In comparing the highly supportive instructors to the lower rated ones, the <em>negative pedagogical</em> code was the most divergent, with this code being nearly absent for the most supportive instructors and representing 30% of responses for the least supportive instructor.</li>
<li>Interestingly, the <em>instrumental</em> code, which describes the "what" of instructor support rather than the how and why, did not correlate with the overall supportiveness of the instructor.</li>
</ul>

<p class="figure_caption"><strong>Examples of the themes and codes developed by the authors to classify student explanations of instructor supportiveness (modified from Figure 2 in Schussler et al.). Note that the instrumental theme was positive by definition, whereas the others could be either positive or negative.</strong></p>

<h2>What we might learn from it</h2>
<ul>
<li>This is a small and preliminary study, but results suggest that instances of poor teaching---such as bad or indifferent efforts to explain concepts and answer questions---are more predictive of students overall feeling of instructor support than the specific methods of support offered or an instructor's personality.</li>
<li>Although content-related communication is very important, the work also resonates with recent work on (non-content) <a href="./2021-05-10-instructor-talk">instructor talk</a> and highlights the importance of the non-content dimensions of what instructors do and say.</li>
