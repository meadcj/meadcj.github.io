The [ETX Center][etx-site] is one of the leaders in advancing the technology and learning design of what we refer to as immersive, interactive virtual field trips, or [iVFT][vft-site]. I have previously published a [curriculum & instruction study][JGE-paper] describing the design ideas behind iVFTs and demonstrating their educational effectiveness. Future work will explore the value of specific design approaches within iVFTs as well as their capacity to develop learners' understanding of the process of science or transdisciplinary connections that go beyond science.
