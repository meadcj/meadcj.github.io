## What it says
- Although the authors set out to examine instructional practices that increased and decreased student anxiety, their results ultimately speak more broadly to what separates supportive instructors from unsupportive ones.
- They collected surveys from about 900 students across six biology classes. They then took a qualitative coding approach to identify common themes in how students described their instructors' supportiveness. 
- In comparing the highly supportive instructors to the lower rated ones, the *negative pedagogical* code was the most divergent, with this code being nearly absent for the most supportive instructors and representing 30% of responses for the least supportive instructor.
- Interestingly, the *instrumental* code, which describes the "what" of instructor support rather than the how and why, did not correlate with the overall supportiveness of the instructor.

## What we might learn from it
- This is a small and preliminary study, but results suggest that instances of poor teaching---such as bad or indifferent efforts to explain concepts and answer questions---are more predictive of students overall feeling of instructor support than the specific methods of support offered or an instructor's personality.
- Although content-related communication is very important, the work also resonates with recent work on (non-content) [instructor talk]({% post_url research-tidbits/2021-05-10-instructor-talk %}) and highlights the importance of the non-content dimensions of what instructors do and say.
