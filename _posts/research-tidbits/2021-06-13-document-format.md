## What we might learn from it
- This article highlights a number of ways in which the value for learning of authentic sources and documents goes beyond their mere *content* and includes aspects of their context. These help students to learn to judge the credibility of sources or why two sources may disagree as well as aiding memory.
- Thinking particularly about computer-based learning, it's worth considering the ways that the user interface design and related functional aspects of these learning environments help or hinder students when analyzing documents. If the documents can only be viewed out of context and if comparisons across documents are inconvenient, then we should predict less learning and, in particular, a less integrated understanding across multiple documents.
