In addition to my work in education research, I have served and continue to serve as project evaluator for projects funded by NASA, NSF, and the U.S. Department of Education. <!--more--> I find evaluation work quite rewarding, particularly in the developmental phase of projects where I am able to help project teams to clarify their goals and measurable outcomes.
