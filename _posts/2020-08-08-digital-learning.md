My research has focused on understanding how digital learning experiences can be designed and used most effective in helping students to learn. Much of this work is design-based research, so I am fortunate to be working with the [ETX Center][etx-site] at ASU, who are continually exploring new ways to make effective use of technology in education.

One productive area of work has been the fully online *Habitable Worlds* course. The course exemplifies the [learning design approach][etx-model] and use of educational technology that ETX strives to use in each of its designs. Our [article][habworlds-paper], published in the journal *Astrobiology*, describes the course as a whole. We also take advantage of the course's powerful learning analytics capabilities to present evidence of learning in the course. I am currently studying the effects of sending targeted, early-intervention emails to students which is informed by analysis of the success or failure of students from prior course offerings.
