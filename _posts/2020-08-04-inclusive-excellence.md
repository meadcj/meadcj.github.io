Most of my research examines how science education can be made more effective, but effectiveness only partially captures the overall mission of a university or other school.

I am currently working with a team at ASU funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's [Inclusive Excellence][hhmi-ie] program to study ASU's growing online degree and course offerings in order to understand whether they are providing _inclusive excellence_.

I recently co-authored a [paper][plos] with this group.
